I am a semi-recent graduate who has worked as a Morgan Stanley Operations Analyst for the last two years. In this role I was a member of a Client Onboarding Regulatory Services team where I primarily analyzed internal processes and collaborated in driving automation. My bachelor's degree is in Business Administration with a concentration in Investments, I also have the Security+ certification and am currently completing the Google Cybersecuity Professional Certificate program.

## Objective

My experience working closely with technology teams at Morgan Stanley combined with my experience in technical support and security networking has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity. I am eager to transition into the field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or as a Business Analyst working between business and Cybersecuririty teams.
