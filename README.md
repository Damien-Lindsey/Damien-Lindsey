### Cybersecurity Professional Summary
Since resigning from my role as a Morgan Stanley Operations Analyst, I've moved to Tampa, Florida and become a full-time Cybersecurity student. In my last role as well as in my two years in tech support I developed an interest in using technology to solve problems and make processes more efficient. This interest propelled me to acquire the Security+ and Google Cybersecurity Certifications as well as complete numerous technical projects. This interest has become a passion and this page is for you to view those projects. In my search for a full-time security/infosec analyst position I look forward to being an asset to team responsible for making the lives others easier.
